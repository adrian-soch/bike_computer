### Description

A wireless bicycle Heads-up-display (HUD) that displays rotations-per-minute (RPM) and heart rate (HR). This project consists of 2 main parts, the HUD and a hub mouted speed sensor. The HUD connectects to an external heart rate sensor for HR data.

This project is designed to make a cheap 'dumb' indoor bicyle trainer more effective by informing the user of their current RPM and HR.
